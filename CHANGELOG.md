## 3.0.0

- updated the `peerDependency` to support `styled-components@^3`
- potential breaking change: upgraded to `styled-components-breakpoint@2.0.0` which only supports breakpoints defined as px
- potential breaking change: removed the `theme` parameter from the mixins, simplifying use of customised breakpoints and spacings
- potential breaking change: removed use of `react-create-component-from-tag-prop` since `styled-components` now has `component.withComponent()`

## 2.1.3

- fix: not used to a new IDE which doesn't auto save

## 2.1.2

- fix: remove undefined margin values

## 2.1.1

- fix: updated the documentation

## 2.1.0

- add: added a `component` prop to customise the underlying element type

## 2.0.4

- fix: Use `prop-types` to make warning with `react@15.5` go away

## 2.0.1-3

- fix: usage examples

## 2.0.0

- break: removed `display: inline-block;` from `<Margin/>` because an `inline-block` wrapping a `block` changes the width of the `block`. e.g. `<Margin><h1/></Margin>` meant the `h1` was unexpectedly not full width
- addition: added a prop named `inline` to change `<Margin/>` and `<Padding/>` to from `block` to `inline-block`.
